A funny automated bot idea for Discord that my friends wanted me to make

## How to Set Up
Fetch the token and IDs for each of the .env variables and paste the corresponding values within each. Your discord token is the client token for the bot, which can be found at https://discord.com/developers/applications. The Server and Channel IDs can be found by right clicking on the server and channels you want the bot to message in, respectively.

Example:
DISCORD_TOKEN=fubar12321..
SERVER_ID=johnsmith456...
CHANNEL_ID=joeregular987...
