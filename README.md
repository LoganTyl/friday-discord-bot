A funny automated bot idea for Discord that my friends wanted me to make

## How to Set Up
Create a .env file in the root directory. Within it, put three variables, "DISCORD_TOKEN", "SERVER_ID", and "CHANNEL_ID". Paste the corresponding values within each. Your discord token is the client token for the bot, which can be found at https://discord.com/developers/applications. The Server and Channel IDs can be found by right clicking on the server and channels you want the bot to message in, respectively.

Example:
DISCORD_TOKEN=fubar12321..
SERVER_ID=johnsmith456...
CHANNEL_ID=joeregular987...
