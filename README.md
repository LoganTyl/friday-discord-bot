# friday-discord-bot
A funny automated bot idea for Discord that my friends wanted me to make

## How to Set Up
Create a .env file in the root directory. Within it, put three variables, "DISCORD_TOKEN", "SERVER_ID", and "CHANNEL_ID". 

Example:
DISCORD_TOKEN=fubar12321..
SERVER_ID=johnsmith456...
CHANNEL_ID=joeregular987...
